# Curbside Management Tool

## Background
The Curbside Management Tool is intended to help with curbside management, inventory, and allocation using quality curb asset data to temporally and spatially prioritize demand and allocation of the curb using ArcGIS Pro. The Tool should be used to build from existing curb inventory data to begin planning the prioritization of curbside uses and allocation. The Tool is built to be extensible regardless of jurisdiction size or area of interest for curbside management planning. The Tool is built upon the foundation of the ITE Curbside Management Practitioners Guide and the FHWA Curbside Inventory Report (forthcoming). 

The Curbside Management Tool contains a suite of components that facilitate data collection, analysis, and treatment recommendations for curbside regulation and public right-of-way (ROW) allocation. With the help of the Curbside Management Tool User Guide, a transportation professional with GIS experience should be able to identify relevant treatment options to help agencies allocate curbs and public ROW in line with policy priorities. This Tool will allow transportation professionals to understand applications of curbside treatments, whether the organization has curb asset data and established curb policies or not.

The tool is written in Arcpy and usable with ArcGIS Pro version 2.4 or higher.

## User Guide

The Curbside Management Tool User Guide provides instructions, for transportation professionals with GIS experience, on how to gather, analyze, and assess curb related information, including applicable requirements, software, data, and experience level. The User Guide will walk through how to use all components of the Tool. 

## Treatment Priority Lookup Table

The Treatment Priority Lookup Table is an essential component which provides users guidance to the component to analyze with the ROW Centerlines. It is available as a separate table both within the GitHub repository and on ITE’s Curbside webpage.

## FHWA_Curbside_Tools.tbx

The FHWA_Curbside_Tool.tbx toolbox is loadable in ArcGIS Pro version 2.4 or higher. Details on the toolbox contents are in the User Guide.

## Scripts folder

The scripts folder contains the arcpy scripts used within the FHWA_Curbside_Tool tbx file, or each individual tool component can run as a standalone scripts in ArcGIS Pro. 

## Sample_data

The Sample data provided allows a user to become familiar with the Tool and the required data to run the Tool and receive outputs if they do not have their own curbside data available.
