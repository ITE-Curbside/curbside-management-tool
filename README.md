# Background
The foundation of curbside management is an underlying source of quality curb asset data. Curbside management data exists at the intersection of curb asset data and temporally and spatially prioritized use of the curb both plan the future of the organizationâ€™s curb uses within ArcGIS Pro. The Curbside Management Tool is intended to help plan the use of curb space. The Tool should be used to build from existing curb inventory to begin planning the prioritization of curb use. The Tool is built to be extensible regardless of jurisdiction size, or area of interest for curbside management planning. The Tool is built upon the foundation of the ITE Curbside Management Practitioners Guide and the FHWA Curbside Inventory Report. 

# Curbside Management Tool

The Curbside Management Tool contains a suite of components that facilitate data collection, analysis, and treatment recommendations for curbside regulation and public right-of-way (ROW) allocation. With the help of this Guide, a transportation professional with GIS experience should be able to identify relevant treatment options to help agencies allocate curbs and public ROW in line with policy priorities. This Tool will allow a transportation professional (analyst) to understand applications of curbside treatments whether the organization has curb asset data and established curb policies or not. The tool is written in Arcpy and usable with ArcGIS Pro version 2.4 or higher.
